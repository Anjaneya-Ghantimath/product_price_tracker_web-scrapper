# üìß Gmail Setup Guide for Price Tracker

This guide will help you configure Gmail to send email alerts from your Price Tracker application.

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. **Go to Google Account Settings**
   - Visit [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Sign in with your Gmail account

2. **Navigate to Security**
   - Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
   - Look for "2-Step Verification"

3. **Enable 2-Step Verification**
   - Click "Get started" if not already enabled
   - Follow the setup process (phone number, backup codes, etc.)
   - **Important**: This is required to generate app passwords

### Step 2: Generate App Password

1. **Go to App Passwords**
   - In Google Account Settings, go to "Security"
   - Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"
   - You might need to sign in again

   - Select "Mail" from the dropdown
   - Select "Other (Custom name)" for device
   - Enter "Price Tracker" as the name
   - Click "Generate"

3. **Copy the Password**
   - Google will show a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - **Copy this password immediately** - you won't see it again!
   - Remove spaces: `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 3: Configure Your .env File

1. **Create .env File**
   - In your `price_tracker` directory, create a file named `.env`
   - Add the following content:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com

# Email Settings
QUIET_HOURS_START=22:00
QUIET_HOURS_END=08:00
DIGEST_FREQUENCY=daily
MAX_EMAILS_PER_HOUR=10

# Database
DATABASE_PATH=./data/products.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

2. **Replace the Values**
   - Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address
   - Replace `abcdefghijklmnop` with your actual 16-character app password

### Step 4: Test Your Configuration

1. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Go to Email Management**
   - Click on "Email Management" in the sidebar
   - Go to the "Gmail Setup" tab
   - Click "üß™ Test Email Configuration"

3. **Check Your Email**
   - If successful, you'll receive a test email
   - If it fails, check your .env file configuration
